It seems like you've provided a large amount of text related to building and compiling C programs using the `make` command. I'll try to summarize the key points for you:

1. **Building and Compiling**: The process involves writing source code in C, then using the `gcc` compiler to create object files from these sources. Finally, the linker is used to combine these object files into an executable file.

2. **Makefiles**: A makefile is a text file that contains instructions for building and compiling programs. It's used by the `make` command to determine which steps are necessary to build a program.

3. **Variables in Makefiles**: Variables can be defined in a makefile to simplify its readability. For example, you could define a variable named `OBJ` to hold the names of object files that need to be compiled.

4. **Phases of Building**: The process of building and compiling a program involves several phases:
   - Compiling source code into object files.
   - Linking these object files together to create an executable file.

5. **Using Makefiles with Multiple Source Files**: If you have multiple source files, each one needs to be compiled separately before they can be linked together. This is where the `make` command comes in handy, as it can automatically determine which steps are necessary based on the dependencies specified in your makefile.

6. **Cleaning Up Object Files and Executable**: You can add a `clean` target to your makefile that uses the `rm` command to remove object files and executable files after they've been built.

7. **Using Make with Specific Targets**: The `make` command allows you to specify which targets in your makefile you want to build. For example, if you only want to compile a specific source file without linking it, you can use the `-c` option followed by the name of that source file.

8. **Viewing Object Files with Hexadecimal Dumps**: The `objdump` command is used to view the contents of object files in hexadecimal format. This can be useful for debugging purposes or understanding how the compiler has translated your C code into machine code.
