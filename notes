Add a rest api into the code because code is currently too messy and it would be easier 
split it into different parts so the code is more optimized 
1. break it apart
    break it down into 3 separate files for more readability and optimization 
2. summarize 
3. save to file 
4. try to use java to make the same code to see the differences 
- explain k means clustering in comments and learn about langchain 
- ignore extracting images and graphs for now and do this first 


- create one for POST each one of the files and then combine them using postman  
- remove all the extra details and just append the file into a pdf 

1. chunk, call the LLM to categorzie the chunk -> something to store and categorize what each chunk
