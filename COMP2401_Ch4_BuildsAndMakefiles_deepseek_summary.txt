The provided text appears to be a mix of code snippets and text and binary data, but the user message is asking for summary. I need to summarize the content. The content. 

The content is about Makefile example for compiling C programs, showing how to use variables and clean up. 

First part defines variable OBJ = linkExample link.o then use in make commands. 

all: gcc $(OBJ to compile all 

Then main: compile main.c and link.c and util.c with gcc 

clean: remove OBJ to clean up 

Example shows how to use rm 

Also shows how to call specific targets like main or clean 

But user said to summarize: 

Makefile example shows how to use variables in Makefiles to compile C programs and clean up objects 

Also shows targets like all 

But the binary data at end is hex maybe from file but not relevant or error ignore 

So focus on text part 

Summary: Makefile shows how to use variables and clean targets in Makefiles for compiling C programs
